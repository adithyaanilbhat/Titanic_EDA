# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains the files and visualizations for Task 2 of the Elevate AI ML Internship Labs: an exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset. It covers summary statistics, univariate and multivariate visualizations, and feature-level insights as required in the task guidelines.

## Files
- Titanic_EDA.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing all code, visualizations, and explanations.
- titanic_summary.csv: Descriptive statistics table for all features (as CSV).
- histograms.png: Combined histograms for key numeric features.
- boxplots.png: Boxplots for key numeric features.
- pairplot.png: Pairplot for feature correlations.
- correlation_matrix.png: Visualization of feature correlations.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local system.
2. Open Titanic_EDA.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Ensure you have pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy installed (these are required for EDA).
4. Dataset used: [Titanic CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pandas-dev/pandas/master/doc/data/titanic.csv)

## Summary of Analysis
- Explored trends, distributions, and correlations among features.
